<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the culmination of the work we have put into several of our classes in the second semester of the Humber Web Development program. The goal is to showcase our ability to envision, plan, and implement a large-scale project with real-world application. Our team was tasked with evaluating the existing website for the Manitouadge General Hospital, taking inventory of the content, and reimagining it as a web application that could be used to enhance communication and health management for the Manitouadge community. This involved a thorough reconstruction of the information architecture, as well as exploring and evaluating new content and features that would be compatible with the goals of the hospital, in addition to developing a completely new visual design.

What you will find in this repository are the first steps towards making our vision a reality. The duration of a single semester did not allow for us to fully complete the implementation of our design, but does showcase our general skills and abilities and allows the user to accurately imagine what the final result could be.

### Built With

* [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Features


### Alerts
The Alerts feature will allow users to see upcoming events, job postings and everything that users need to know in regards to health regulations, policies, vaccinations etc. The purpose of this feature is for users to get immediate access to new happenings within the community.

My View model is currently not working and this is something I would like to fix in the next semester, as well as adding admin roles to my code.

### Events
Hospitals are underfunded, especially with the demand from them in this current time. The events feature is a means of fundraising for the hospital and also for donating to certain charities. One thing we noticed is how important community is to the northern Ontario communities. Having events would be a way for the community to come together while also helping the hospital and charities that are in need.

My View model is currently not working and this is something I would like to fix in the next semester, as well as adding admin roles to my code.

### Donations Feature
The donation feature will let users (visitors) send in a donation amount to the hospital. There will be a donation button present on the top right corner of the homepage. It will also be present on the bottom of the homepage to make it easier and quick for the user to navigate to the donations page. Once redirected, the user will be sent to the main donations page where the user will be asked to fill out their general information. This is also where users are able to donate to a an event or just donate towards the hospital. 

I would have liked to implement a captcha feature to validated the user donating once the database in able to hold the data I would also like to add in a paypall API to direct users to a payment page with the values inputted in the donation form fields to create a personalized payment page giving user a feel good experience while donating.

### Department Feature
- The departments feature is directories and provides information about each department.

Visitors to the website will see a link called, “department” under For Medical Professionals section in footer and be able to click on the link and view the department information, such as department neme, categories, phone number as well as extension numbers, email address, and FAX.

The department feature will have an administrative backend that will manage the departments. Administration staff can create, display, update, delete the contents by content management system. Administrative users will have to login to the administrative side of the application and then choose “Department” from the available links on the main dashboard. On the department page, user click one of the lists to editor delete, or if it was the first time to edit the Departments, there is no list so they can create a new department.

The Job posting entity is associated with the Departments entity. These have one to many relationships. department_id in Job posting will be a foreign key to retrieve department name (and other information) for job posting

### Job Posting Feature
- The Job posting feature is that the hospital can announce the job availability and recruit the public on the home page.

Visitors to the website will see the job posting under Recruitment on the main navigation. Each job posting may include the contents such as department information, job title, job description, salary, deadline for the application. Also, from this page, visitors to the website can apply for the job (“Apply for the job” is another feature).
The job posting feature will have an administrative backend that will manage the job posting. Administration staff can create, display, update, delete the contents by content management system. Administrative users will have to login to the administrative side of the application and then choose “Job Posting” from the available links on the main dashboard. On the Job posting page, user clicks one of the lists to edit or delete, or create a new job posting.

### Invoices

In Canada we are lucky to have the amazing, publicly funded health care system that we have. Unfortunately, there are times when a visit to the hospital incurs expenses that are not covered by that system and must be paid by an individual. Some of those expenses are services, like ambulance rides or having a private room. Others can be physical products like post operative braces or supports.

Regardless of the type of expense, it makes sense to have a list of the services and products that have an additional cost. It also makes sense to have the ability to easily create invoices for those services and products, issue the invoices to a recipient, and keep track of whether they have been paid or not. This feature provides that ability.
